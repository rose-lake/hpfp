# Haskell Programming From First Principles

My work on HPFP, organized by chapter under `src/ch#/`

## Context

I started learning Haskell during my mini batch at [the Recurse Center (RC)](https://www.recurse.com/apply) in February 2020, both on my own and as part of a self-organized study group. We started out with Graham Hutton's excellent text.

Since then, I've continued working on Haskell on my own, and collaborating in our RC Haskell Study Group which continues to meet remotely. I'm still using Hutton's [Programming in Haskell (2016)](https://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pih.html) but have now started working through [Haskell Programming from First Principles](https://haskellbook.com/).

I recommend Hutton for getting up and running speedily, and HPFP has been really excellent for coming back around and building up the foundations.

## To run and interact with the examples

Open a REPL, load in the desired example, and play away!

## Random Tidbits

### Haskell's `quot` `rem` `div` and `mod`
I took some time to grok this, and put my thoughts in [`/src/ch2/quotientRemainder_vs_divideModulo.md`](https://github.com/rose-lake/hpfp/blob/master/src/ch2/quotientRemainder_vs_divideModulo.md)
